# My Personal Portfolio

This is a simple personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a text editor (like VS Code) and a web browser installed on your machine.

2. **Steps**: 
   - Clone or download the repository.
   - If using Git, run `git clone <repository-url>`.
   - Create a new folder, and copy the following files into it:
     - `index.html`
     - `styles.css`
     - `script.js`
     - (Optional) An `images` folder for any portfolio images.

3. **Run the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional build tools or dependencies are required.

## Usage

Once installed, you can:

- View the portfolio in any modern web browser.
- Customize the content by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- To make changes, edit the files in your text editor and save; the changes will reflect automatically in the browser.

## API Documentation

This project is a static website and does not expose a formal API. However, the JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains functions that can be used for interactivity, such as:

- `updateContent(section, data)`: A hypothetical function to update content sections dynamically. For example, it could be used to load project details from a data structure.
- `handleFormSubmit(event)`: Handles form submissions for contact sections.

To use these functions, include them in your JavaScript code and call them with appropriate parameters. Since this is a basic portfolio, the API is minimal and intended for demonstration purposes. For a production environment, consider extending it with actual data sources.
