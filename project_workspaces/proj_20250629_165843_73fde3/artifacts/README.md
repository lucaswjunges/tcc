# Simple Flask Web Application

This is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates how to create a basic web app with a hello world endpoint. It includes installation instructions, usage examples, project structure, and specific code snippets.

## Description
This project is a straightforward Flask application that responds to requests at the root URL ('/') with a 'Hello, World!' message. It's ideal for beginners learning Flask or as a starting point for more complex applications.

## Installation
Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed. Then, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository (or download the code):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-flask-app.git
   cd simple-flask-app
   ```
   *Note: Replace the URL with your actual repository if hosted elsewhere.*

2. Install Flask using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   flask --version
   ```
   This should display the installed Flask version.

## Usage
To run the application, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-flask-app
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   *Note: Ensure you have a file named `app.py` with the code provided below.*

3. The app will start a development server by default. You can access the hello world endpoint by visiting `http://localhost:5000/` in a web browser or using tools like `curl`.

## Project Structure
The project has a minimal structure. Here's an overview:

```
├── app.py
└── (other files, if any)
``` 

- **app.py**: Contains the main Flask application code. Here's what it looks like:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      return 'Hello, World!'

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True)
  ```

## Examples
### Example 1: Accessing the Hello World Endpoint
After starting the app, you can test it by sending a GET request to the root URL.

- **Using a web browser:** Open `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser. It should display 'Hello, World!'.

- **Using curl:** In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000
  ```
  This will output: `Hello, World!`

### Example 2: Modifying the Endpoint
You can customize the hello world message by editing the `hello_world` function in `app.py`. For instance, change the return value to something else, like 'Welcome to Flask!'.

### Example 3: Running with Gunicorn (for production-like environment)
For a more robust setup in production, you can use Gunicorn:
1. Install Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```
2. Run the app with Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:app
   ```
   Then access it at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Additional Notes
- The `debug=True` in `app.py` enables debug mode, which provides detailed error pages and auto-reloads the server on code changes. For production, set `debug=False`.
- Ensure you handle any potential errors, such as missing dependencies.
